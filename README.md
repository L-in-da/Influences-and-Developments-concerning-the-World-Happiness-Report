# Influences and Developments concerning the World Happiness Report
The World Happiness Report is a yearly publication documenting and analysing developments in people's happiness all over the world.
In our project, we used the data from the [World Happiness Report]{https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report-20152021} (years 2015 to 2021)
in order to see how much influence different factors have on citizens' overall happiness, how happiness differs for each country and
how it changes over time.

For this purpose we used LinearRegression (LinearRegression2021.ipynb), analyzed happiness scores for 2021 (AnalyzingHapinessData2021.ipynb)
and over time (AnalyzingHapinessData2015-2021.ipynb).
Our investigation shows that the hapiness scores vary across countries and over time. The additionally considered key features (logged gross domestic product (GDP) per 
capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption) help to predict the happiness scores
for different countries quite well, but due to correlations between these factors it is only possible to interpret their influence to a limited extend.
